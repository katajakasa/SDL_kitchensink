/**
 * @brief Creates a new player from a source.
 *
 * Creates a new player from the given source. The source must be previously successfully
 * initialized by calling either Kit_CreateSourceFromUrl() or Kit_CreateSourceFromCustom(),
 * and it must not be used by any other player. Source must stay valid during the whole
 * playback (as in, don't close it while stuff is playing).
 *
 * It is possible to request for audio and video format conversions to be done automatically by
 * supplying requests via video_format_request and audio_format_request arguments. Conversions
 * are done on software, so they WILL add some cpu load! If you don't care what the output format is,
 * then just leave these to NULL, or feed the request objects but reset them to defaults with
 * Kit_ResetVideoFormatRequest() and Kit_ResetAudioFormatRequest().
 *'
 * Screen width and height are used for subtitle positioning, scaling and rendering resolution.
 * Ideally this should be precisely the size of your screen surface (in pixels).
 * Higher resolution leads to higher resolution text rendering. This MUST be set precisely
 * if you plan to use font hinting! If you don't care or don't have subtitles at all,
 * set both to video surface size or 0.
 *
 * For streams, either video and/or audio stream MUST be set! Either set the stream indexes manually,
 * or pick them automatically by using Kit_GetBestSourceStream().
 *
 * If hardware accelerated decoding has been enabled in Kit_Init(), then an automatic acquisition
 * of hardware decoder context is attempted. If acquiring a hardware decoder fails, we fall back to standard
 * software decoding.
 *
 * On success, this will return an initialized Kit_Player which can later be freed by Kit_ClosePlayer().
 * On error, NULL is returned and a more detailed error is available via Kit_GetError().
 *
 * For example:
 * ```
 * Kit_VideoFormatRequest v_req;
 * Kit_ResetVideoFormatRequest(&v_req);
 * v_req.hw_device_types = KIT_HWDEVICE_TYPE_VAAPI | KIT_HWDEVICE_TYPE_VDPAU;
